# The FreeDOS Installer (FDI)

The [FreeDOS](http://freedos.org) Installer is a customizable and flexible
batch based installation kit based on the
[V8Power Tools](http://up.lod.bz/V8Power) batch file enhancement utilities.


For installation using floppy diskettes, the
[FDI-x86](https://github.com/shidel/FDI-x86) is used instead of FDI. Although
it is a completely different installer, it is referred to as an ADD-ON to FDI.
This is because FDI-x86 needs the settings and configuration files that are
part of FDI to be create install media.
