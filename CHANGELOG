# Change Log

    The FDI change log only covers the FreeDOS Installer. It does not cover
    any of the tools used by the installer or any of the programs installed
    by FDI.

## FDI 1.3-RC5

	Updated FREEDOC readme to reflect changes with the release media.
	Package List Modifications.
    Loosened license statement to permit any GPL version for ALL installer files.
    Added test for existing MBR code. When present, prompt to overwrite.
    Removed some old unused code.
    Added note to project README pointing to Floppy Edition (FDI-x86) installer.
    People like change logs. So, I started one for FDI. :-)

## FDI & FreeDOS 1.2

Starting with FreeDOS v1.2, FDI is the official installer for FreeDOS.
