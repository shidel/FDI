Things planned for x86 installer .. Eventually.

* Language selection when run at boot or when LANG is not set.
* Install only XMSSWAP or KSWAP version of FreeCOM based on CPU, probably English + Language specific version

Things that aren't actually the installer, but are improvements planned that effect it.

* Add compression support to SLICER
* Improve SLICER to skip archives that are not needed.
* Fix issue with VINFO CPU detecting some processors at a lower level then reality. (thinks my 486 is a 186)
* Add support for video cards older than EGA to V8Power Tools and FDIMPLES.
