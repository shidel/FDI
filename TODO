Things planned for FDI installer .. Eventually.

* Reorder the Config Menu to eliminate the need for a separate VirtualBox AutoExec.

Things that aren't actually the installer, but are improvements planned that effect it.

* Create VVIEW to read DOCs during install
* Update VCHOICE to support lists
* Get around to making V8Turbo for overall better performance.
